This code would help you conduct a mosaic analysis of continuous numerical research data, that is, test whether individuals possess only male-typical or only female-typical measures or are mosaics of both female-typical and male-typical measures. With this code you will be able to choose the measures to be included in the mosaic analysis and the exact cutoff used to define the female-typical (F), intermediate (N), and male-typical (M) ranges of scores for each measure. The output of the code is the number of mosaic individuals (possessing both F and M measures) and the number of internally consistent individuals (possessing only F or only M measures). See Joel et al 2015, PNAS, for details(https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1509654112).

Please read carefully the instructions detailed in the code to get the proper results.
